h5pres
======

h5pres, HTML5 presentation JavaScript drop-in, heavily based on and partially copied from: https://github.com/ear1grey/h5pres

At the moment designed to have none of the styling and just single layer sections. Multi depth sections and auto index generation will come soon.

This will only work in modern browsers and I currently have no intention of changing that. Another limitation is that a page can only contain one article elemt to contain the slideshow.

Commands:
+ . - Toggle slideshow
+ right arrow, down arrow - Next slide
+ left arrow, up arrow - Previous slide
